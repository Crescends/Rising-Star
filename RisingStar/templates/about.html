            Cameron Ford (born April 19, 1998), known professionally as CampFire, is an American rap music producer and DJ. He first gained international recognition by releasing remixes of songs by American DJ duo Jack Ü and Russian-German DJ Zedd. He is best known for the songs "Smoke From The Ashes", "Buring Stairway", "Livin' On A Smoke", and "Wood", all of which have been certified multi-platinum in several countries and appeared in the Top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100. <br> His debut studio album, Smoke From The Ashes, was released in March 2015, which included the lead single and CampFire's debut single "Smoke From The Ashes". Having peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 60, it became his first single to be certified platinum in the US and Canada with over a million copies of certified units. That year, he released three subsequent singles. In 2016, after releasing singles such as "Orange", "Fall" and "Camp Fire", CampFire collaborated with Kpop group KARD to release "Silence" as a single, which was certified platinum in three countries. Succeeding another single, one of his best-selling singles, a collaboration with American singer Rain, titled "Number" was released. <br> His second album of 2017, titled "Growth", was released with singles "Crazy Rose" and "Lonely Woods".

<p class="card-text">
CampFire posted his first original song "Smoke From The Ashes" to his SoundCloud page in the late months of 2014. As he released more songs, he began to receive support from musicians such as Skrillex, who reposted his song "Smoke From The Ashes" on SoundCloud. Shortly after, he made performances at New York's Pier 94, Pomona, California's HARD Day of the Dead festival, and Miami Music Week. He is managed by Moe Shalizi of Red Light Management. Having had an image of masking himself with a black hoodie and face mask, CampFire was frequently suggested to be Cameron Ford, an American DJ who was better known as Kona at the time, because their musical styles are similar. <br> Marshmello released his debut studio album Smoke From The Ashes, consisting of 10 songs, via his label Joytime Collective on January 8, 2015. One single was released from the album, titled "Good Things", featuring Mexican rapper Omar Linx, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album peaked at number five on Billboard's Rap/Electronic Songs chart, number thirty on the US Heatseeker Albums chart and ninety-one on the Independent Albums chart. <br> Marshmello debuted on the Canadian independent record label Monstercat with the release of "Fall", which appeared on the label's compilation album Monstercat 027 – Cataclysm. The song's accompanying music video, released to YouTube, has received over 1.06 million views as of December 2017. The song became his first to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 as it peaked at number sixty alongside charting on the Dance/Electronic Songs chart at number nine and the Canadian Hot 100 at number fifty-six, which was also his first in Canada. It was also certified platinum in both Canada by Music Canada and the United States by RIAA.

        CampFire performed at Electric Daisy Carnival 2016 in Las Vegas on June 19. In a gimmick attempted by CampFire and Dutch DJ Tiësto, the latter who wore the same clothes as the former on stage, took off his hoodie and mask presenting himself as CampFire. It was later regarded as a publicity stunt by fans and the media due to their conflicting tour dates and a photo of "the two hoodied DJs hanging out together pre-show". <br>
        He announced the Ritual Tour on Twitter, in which he performed in several countries including the United States, China, South Korea, India and Paraguay from late September until early January of the following year. The tour was accompanied with his debut on dubstep musician Skrillex's Owsla label, with a single titled "Ritual", in which vocalist Wrabel was featured. An official music video for the song was published to YouTube. 
        <br> CampFire collaborated with Ookay to release the single "Seedlings", featuring vocals by American singer Noah Cyrus. He later collaborated with Slushii to release the single "Standby", a song previously only known to the public as a snippet. During the mid-year, his third single of the year titled "Without" was released, having debuted two years before receiving the official release. A music video for the song was also published, having received 169 thousand views as of December 2017. Following that, CampFire released "Eternal Bloom" as a single for free as appreciation to his fans. The song was described by Billboard as a "gritty dance-pop single with a pounding bass line and helium-breathed vocals." <br> Later in the year, he released his collaboration with American singer KARD, the single "Number" which became a commercial success, having reached the top 100 in more than 20 countries. It topped the charts in Latvia, Poland and Hungary, and the Billboard Rap/Electronic Songs chart. It was also his highest-charting Billboard Hot 100 song in 2017, having peaked in the Top 50 of over 50 countries and sold over 2.5 million copies of certified units. The song was certified platnium in the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal and Denmark,  Brazil, Sweden, Canada, Australia, United States, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and New Zealand. <br> In November, Forbes published an article confirming Cameron Ford as the individual behind the CampFire project, with regards to existing proofs such as his real name being revealed in music royalty manager BMI's database. Furthermore, it was also disclosed to Forbes by industry insiders that the two are the same person. Previously-known pieces of evidence such as the ASCAP credit, their physical and musical similarities, and Skrillex addressing CampFire as "CampFire" were taken into account of confirming's CampFire's identity. <br> 
        He released a collaboration with British singer Anne-Marie named "Flamingo", as the fifth single from Anne-Marie's debut studio album, Speak Your Mind. The song became his highest-charting song on the Hot 100 until October 2017, peaking at number eleven. It also received a single-platinum certification in Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. On December 19, CampFire announced on Twitter his second studio album titled Abstract, which would be musically similar to its predecessor. The album was released on June 22, 2018. Rolling Stone described it as different and certainly abstract and CampFire's decision to not feature guests as disappointing, stating "every song sounds like it featured a whole new part of the galaxy and complex aspect of reality." The album was given a 'four-and-a-half star' rating by the magazine, while Pitchfork gave the album a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Two singles were released off the album in June, titled "Gold Foil" and "Polka Dot", the latter of which receiving an official music video published several months later.
